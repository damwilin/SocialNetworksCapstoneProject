DATA SOURCE
-------------------

facebook_ucsd.txt
This graph contains Facebook friendships between students at UCSD in 2005. 
This data was originally stored in a Matlab sparse matrix; however, this was 
processed using Python to create a more suitable format for reading with Java.
The edges in this file are directed; however, each edge also appears in reverse
order, making the final result undirected.
